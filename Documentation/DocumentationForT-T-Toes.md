# Toe Documentation.
This file will contain all documentation pertaining to my code for the tic tac toe project in C

I will do my best to keep a log of the times I work on this project. Look at the commit list to see how the work has developed.
## Feb 7
### 4:00 - 5:00
running into some issues with too many arrays. Going to work on it some more when I get home
## Feb 8
### 8:25 - 8:35 am
Started the Flowchart for the grid printer.
### probably 20 minutes of work during linux
I ran into a probably with the flowchart. Turns out I wasn't signed into lucid through my school account. Long story short, I couldn't make it thw right size. I've fixed the issue though so there shouldn't be any issues with flowchart size. Still a work in process so ignore the version of the pdf found in this commit.
