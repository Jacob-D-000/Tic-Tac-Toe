# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description
This game was created for a final project in our NSCC IT Programming 2007 Course to demonstrate all we learned in that second semister class. The course focused around using C which was quite a change of pace for us since the most we had programmed in at that point was Python. 

The goal of the application is quite simple. Create a playable tic-tac-toe game in C and use the command line an interface. The game contains a simple grid in which when player inputs 2 numbers between 1 and 3, an X or O is placed corresponding cell. The features a rudimentary ai opponent with multiple difficulties as well as the ability to play with friends in a two player mode. The game keeps score between rounds to show how well you have been play.

One skill we developed during was our project was using git. We had prior experince working with git in previous semesters, but we hadn't used it for much more then storage. I this project, we often ran into major errors with files not save properly for one reason or another. We used gits version control in these sisutations to reverts our code into a place where it was eaier to work. We also used branches in an effort to keep each others work seprate until it was ready to merge.

Because this was on of our first projects, we ran into a lot of issues those who hackaway at code might face when working with a bigger scope then they are used to. The project was often filled with scope creep to inlcude features that seemed logical to use but weren't nesscary for completion and weren't agreed on during the plaining phase of our project. This coupled with discriptive yet sparce amounts of documentation led to a diffcult development cycle that led to many late nights siting in class writing code.

The most important thing this project taught us overal was that we need to improve our ablity to plan out projects before hand and only start to expand once we have fisniehd the baiscs reqirements. 

Despite these flaws on our planning, we as a team are very proud of the final product. Despite the creep we encouterd, the features that we had demonstated that we had the abilty to create uniqe work arounds to problems we had faced during development. Overall this project is one that we are proud of display for other to see and use.
